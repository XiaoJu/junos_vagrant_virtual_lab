# junos_vagrant_virtual_lab

virtual lab made of 3 Juniper vSRX routers runing RIP v.2 routing protocol,
brought up through Vagrant.
Lab topology as per [Day One: Routing the Internet Protocol](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/jnbooks/day-one/fundamentals-series/routing-internet-protocol/) Juniper book, page 34.

Use the commnand line to communicate directly with the routers like in real world setups.

Expand on this to experiment with other network topologies and routing protocols. Juniper vSRX routers support RIP, OSPF, IS, etc.

Or move on to a real network simulator such as [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com) or others.
